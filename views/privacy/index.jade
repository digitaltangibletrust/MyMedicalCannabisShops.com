      p If you seek permissions to raise any buy and sell limits associated with your Pearl Financial Account, we may require you to provide additional information which we may use in collaboration with service providers acting on our behalf to verify your identity or address, and/or to manage risk.

      p You may choose to provide us with access to certain personal information stored by third parties such as social media sites (such as Facebook and Twitter).

      strong How we use cookies

      p When you access our website or content or use our application or Pearl Financial services, we, or companies we work with, may place small data files called cookies or pixel tags on your computer or other device. We use these technologies to:
      ul 
        li
          p Recognize you as a Pearl Financial customer;
        li 
          p Customize Pearl Financial services, content, and advertising;
        li 
          p Measure promotional effectiveness; and
        li 
          p Collect information about your computer or other access device to mitigate risk, help prevent fraud, and promote trust and safety.

      p We use both session and persistent cookies when you access our website or content. Session cookies expire and no longer have any effect when you log out of your account or close your browser. Persistent cookies remain on your browser until you erase them or they expire.
  
      p We also use Local Shared Objects, commonly referred to as “Flash cookies,” to help ensure that your account security is not compromised, to spot irregularities in behavior to help prevent fraud and to support our sites and services.
    
      p We encode our cookies so that only we can interpret the information stored in them. You are free to decline our cookies if your browser or browser add-on permits, but doing so may interfere with your use of our website. The help section of most browsers or browser add-ons provides instructions on blocking, deleting, or disabling cookies.

Likewise, these third parties may place cookies or pixel tags that are not subject to our control and the Pearl Financial Privacy Policy does not cover their use.

      strong How we protect and store personal information

      p Throughout this policy, we use the term “personal information” to describe information that can be associated with a specific person and can be used to identify that person. We do not consider personal information to include information that has been anonymized so that it does not identify a specific user.

      p We store and process your personal and transactional information, including certain payment information, such as your encrypted bank account and/or routing numbers, on our computers in the US and elsewhere in the world where Pearl Financial facilities or our service providers are located, and we protect it by maintaining physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards in compliance with applicable US federal and state regulations. We use computer safeguards such as firewalls and data encryption, and we enforce physical access controls to our buildings and files. Furthermore, we authorize access to personal information only for those employees who require it to fulfill their job responsibilities. 

      p We store our customers’ personal information securely throughout the life of the customer’s Pearl Financial Account. Pearl Financial typically retains such customer records for a period of five years following cancellation of the associated Pearl Financial Account.

      strong How we use the personal information we collect

      p Our primary purpose in collecting personal information is to provide you with a secure, smooth, efficient, and customized experience. We may use your personal information to:

      ul 
        li
          p Provide Pearl Financial services and customer support you request;
        li
          p Process transactions and send notices about your transactions;
        li 
          p Resolve disputes, collect fees, and troubleshoot problems;
        li
          p Prevent and investigate potentially prohibited or illegal activities, and/or violations of our posted 
            a(href='/terms/') Terms of Service
            |  or 
            a(href='/prohibited/') Prohibited Business 
            | policies;
        li 
          p Customize, measure, and improve Pearl Financial services and the content and layout of our website and applications;
        li 
          p Deliver targeted marketing, service update notices, and promotional offers based on your communication preferences; and
        li
          p Compare information for accuracy and verify it with third parties.

      strong Marketing
      p We will not sell or rent your personal information to third parties for their marketing purposes without your explicit consent. We may combine your information with information we collect from other companies and use it to improve and personalize Pearl Financial services, content and advertising.

      strong How personal information is shared with other Pearl Financial users
      p To process your payments, we may share some of your personal information with the person or company to which you transfer or from which you receive gold or blockchain assets. Your contact information, date of sign-up, and the number of payments you have received from verified Pearl Financial users or sellers may be provided to other Pearl Financial users or sellers with whom you transact through Pearl Financial. In addition, this and other information you disclose to Pearl Financial may be shared with third parties who may provide, upon your authorization, ancillary services which access your Pearl Financial Account. Unless you have agreed to it, these third parties are not allowed to use this information for any purpose other than to facilitate your transactions using Pearl Financial services.
          
      p If you use your Pearl Financial Account to transfer gold, POCs, or blockchain assets in connection with the purchase or sale of other goods or services, we or you may also provide the seller with your shipping address to help complete your transaction with the seller. The seller is not allowed to use this information to market their services to you unless you have agreed to it. If an attempt to transfer gold, POCs, or blockchain assets to your seller fails or is later invalidated, we may also provide your seller with details of the unsuccessful transfer. To facilitate dispute resolutions, we may provide a buyer with the seller's address so that goods can be returned to the seller.
          
      p In connection with a gold, POC, or blockchain asset transfer between you and a third party, including merchants, a third party may share information about you with us, such as your email address or mobile phone number, which may be used to inform you that a transfer has been sent to or received from the third party. We may use this information in connection with such transfers to confirm that you are a Pearl Financial customer, that gold, POC, or blockchain asset transfers are enabled, and/or to notify you that you have received such gold, POC, or blockchain assets. If you request that we validate your status as a Pearl Financial customer with a third party, we will do so. You may also choose to send gold, POC, or blockchain assets to, or request gold, POC, or blockchain assets from, an e-mail address. In such cases, your user name will be displayed in an e-mail message notifying the user of the designated e-mail address of your action. Please note that merchants you interact with may have their own privacy policies, and Pearl Financial is not responsible for their operations, including, but not limited to, their information practices.

      strong How we share personal information with other parties
      p We may share your personal information with:
      ul
        li
          p Service providers under contract who help with parts of our business operations such as fraud prevention, bill collection, marketing, and technology services. Our contracts dictate that these service providers only use your information in connection with the services they perform for us and not for their own benefit.
        li
          p Financial institutions with which we partner.
        li 
          p Companies that we plan to merge with or be acquired by. (Should such a combination occur, we will require that the new combined entity follow this privacy policy with respect to your personal information. You will receive prior notice of any change in applicable policy.)
        li 
          p Law enforcement, government officials, or other third parties when:
          ul
            li
              p We are compelled to do so by a subpoena, court order, or similar legal procedure; or
            li
              p We believe in good faith that the disclosure of personal information is necessary to prevent physical harm or financial loss, to report suspected illegal activity, or to investigate violations of our User Agreement.
            li 
              p Other third parties with your consent or direction to do so.

      p Pearl Financial will not sell or rent any of your personal information to third parties for their marketing purposes and only shares your personal information with third parties as described in this policy.

      p If you establish a Pearl Financial account indirectly on a third party website or via a third party application, any information that you enter on that website or application (and not directly on a Pearl Financial website) will be shared with the owner of the third party website or application, and your information may be subject to their privacy policies.
      
      p We will notify you of material changes to this policy by updating the last updated date at the top of this page. We recommend that you visit this page frequently to check for changes.
      
      strong How you can access or change your personal information
      p You can review and edit your personal information at any time by logging in to your account and accessing your account information. If you close your Pearl Financial account, we will mark your account in our database as “Closed,” but we will keep your account information in our database for a period of time described above. This is necessary in order to deter fraud, by ensuring that persons who try to commit fraud will not be able to avoid detection simply by closing their account and opening a new account. However, if you close your account, your personally identifiable information will not be used by us for any further purposes, nor sold or shared with third parties, except as necessary to prevent fraud and assist law enforcement, as required by law or in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
    
      strong How you can contact us about privacy questions
      p If you have questions or concerns regarding this policy, you should contact us on our support page or by writing to us at Pearl Financial, Inc. 660 4th Street, #214, San Francisco, CA 94107, USA.
